((SCENE 1))
JUNIS: Helloooo, are you dead?
JUNIS: I think he might be dead..
(Riley stands to his feet.)
JUNIS: [face: happy] Oh! Good, you're alive! For a second I thought I'd have to /drag/ you out!
RILEY: [face: confused] W-What? Wait, okay, let's..rewind a bit. Who are you, exactly?
JUNIS: Oh! The name's Junis! Junis Midnight!
RILEY: [face: neutral] Huh. Nice name.
[face: confused] ...I think.
JUNIS: [face: coy] Sooooo, what's yours?
RILEY: [face: neutral] Riley.
JUNIS: [face: confused] ...Riley.....what?
RILEY: [face: embarrased] Uh, Grimsman. Sorry.
JUNIS: [face: joy] No worries! Everybody forgets their manners sometimes!
RILEY: [face: neutral] ...Right. 
[face: confused] So, mind telling me where the hell I am? I can't say I exactly recognize this place.
JUNIS: Why you're in the Edevus Forest of course!
RILEY: [face: pondering] Huh. Can't say I've heard of it.
JUNIS: Whaaaat? How is that even possible?? It's literally the densest and darkest forest in all of Terran!
RILEY: [face: confused] I'm sorry, Terran? Not sure I follow.
JUNIS: Oh quit acting so silly. C'mon, I'll lead you out of the forest.
RILEY: [face: neutral] Uh..thanks.
JUNIS: Don't mention it! Now just come on and follow be-
[face: baffled] ...Uh-oh.
RILEY: [face: confused] Uh-oh?
JUNIS: Uh-oh.
RILEY: Uh-oh.
Wait, why uh-oh?
(Junis looks ahead of her, at a Shadow.)
JUNIS: That's why uh-oh.
RILEY: [face: shocked] Holy mother of what the fuck is that!?
JUNIS: You...really aren't from around here, are you?
That's a Shadow. It's a Dark elemental monster. Now that might sound kinda scary, but it's a low-level monster, so it shouldn't give us too much trouble.
[face: questioning] You...can fight, right?
RILEY: [face: sly] Of course I can fight. What kind of question is that?
JUNIS: Okay, clearly you're not from around here. But don't worry, I'll guide you through it! Just..summon your weapon.
[face: concerned] Wait, I should probably teach you how to do that, too. Um, so, okay. Just, imagine your ideal weapon, then, imagine it in your hands. Focus on it until it becomes a reality.
(Riley does as told, and summons his weapon.)
RILEY: [face: shocked] Holy nipples, this sword is huuuuge!
[face: coy] Well, you know what they say about huge swords.
JUNIS: [face: joy] Great! Now just walk on up to that little guy so you can start the battle!
